Whoa, I've never heard of that!  Sounds fascinating.  I'm a sucker for a good mystery/philosophical film, so I'm definitely adding this to my watchlist. Thanks for the recommendation!  The premise alone is intriguing.  I'm particularly interested in how they handle the "is he crazy or not" aspect - that's usually where these kinds of films either shine or fall flat.
