Title: Sometimes,strangers just get it

A few weeks ago, I was having the worst day. You know the kind everything goes wrong, and suddenly you’re questioning your entire existence. I ended up at a coffee shop, just staring at my drink, trying so hard not to cry in public.
Then, out of nowhere, the barista slipped me an extra cookie and just said, “I don’t know what’s going on, but cookies help.” That’s it. No questions, no awkward pity, just a tiny act of kindness.
And you know what? It did help. Not just the cookie (which was amazing, btw), but the reminder that people can be really, really good.

I clicked this picture to go back to it on a day when all seems wrong
