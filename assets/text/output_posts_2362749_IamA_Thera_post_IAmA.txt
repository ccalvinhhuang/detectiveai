Title: IamA Therapist who was diagnosed with 5+ Mental Disorders and no longer wanted to live. I recovered. I just launched a new service aimed not at diagnosing and treating illness, but at recovering and finding wellness. AMA about your Mental Health!

Hey there all,

I'm Adam Holman, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and Mental Health therapist who has been practicing in the mental health space for \~10-years.

For the first 25 years of my life, I believed I was permanently broken. Truthfully, I no longer wanted to live. I had tried therapy on multiple occasions from childhood to adulthood, I tried medication, and often times left feeling worse. Through the course of my treatment history, I collected over 5+ mental health diagnoses ranging from Social Anxiety, to Generalized Anxiety, to Major Depression, to PTSD, to ADHD. At the head of it all, I got kicked out of university after failing for three years straight with a GPA of 1.6, and I was playing video games for 16 hours per day to cope.

To make a very long story very short, I recovered not through therapy, but through a mix of many self-help resources. I no longer meet the criteria for any of these diagnoses, I haven't for years, and not only do I want to live, life feels like an absolute privilege and gift.

I ended up returning to university and graduated with a 4.0. I went into the mental health field because I wanted others to experience what I experienced, and knew I would spend the rest of my life doing just that.

As I worked with more clients, I started seeing something I couldnâ€™t ignore: many aspects of the way that we provide therapy and talk about diagnosis are at best, preventing many people from recovering, at worst, making some people sick. In fact, as much as it hurt to admit, the way that *I* was practicing therapy was keeping people in the same loop that I was stuck in.

I started to measure my sessions and realized what works and what doesn't. I watched others recover as I did, and realized that we don't even consider recovery to be an option. I also understood more deeply what causes us to feel stuck, and realized that the entire concept of therapy involves coping with and labeling symptoms instead of addressing the root of our challenges. The more that I implemented what I learned, the faster I watched people recover, with some people recovering in the time frame of just a few weekly sessions.

I ended up feeling an intense shame and guilt for not practicing in a way that allows people to recover, and at the same time, aspects of the medical therapy model required me not to. For that reason, recently, I closed down my therapy practice and put my head down to build something new. I call it Guided Self-Mentorship, and it gives people the tools needed to *actually* recover, not just feel better. It's not a magic bullet, it's not a quick fix, and it won't cause you to suddenly feel better forever. What it will do is help you feel better in a single moment over your particular life challenges, understand what caused you to feel better, and use what you understood to continue doing so for the remainder of your life.

One last bit - if you feel skeptical, *I would hope so.* The claims being made here are radical, and go counter to a lot of what is believed to be true. I don't want you to simply believe me. It's the willingness to question and not accept what we're told as truth that allows us to discover what's actually true. I simply ask that you be willing to approach that skepticism with curiosity and ask questions so you can discover what makes sense to you.

Ask me anything about mental health, recovery, the roots of common challenges like anxiety, depression, addictions, relationship problems, and trauma, and the current state of therapy.
