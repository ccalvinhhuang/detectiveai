Okay, lets ball. "I just launched a new service aimed not at diagnosing and treating illness, but at recovering and finding wellness" Do you worry this service, treating this as what sets your service apart, a de-facto if not literal sales pitch, servces to reinforce the stigma against traditional long term therapy and methods of care?

In other words, do you worry about presenting this with too much novelty emphasized, the novelty itself serving as a type of soft dogwhistle or statement itself about the usefulness of traditional therapy? Certain parts of your OP have me concerned, like " it gives people the tools needed to actually recover, not just feel better" as in, you are making a point there implicitly that traditional routes of therapy are focused on "just making you feel better" are you not?
