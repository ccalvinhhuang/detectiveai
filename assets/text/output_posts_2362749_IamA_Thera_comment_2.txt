I have in fact heard this as an attempt to create a dialogue and not an attempt to be confrontational, and in a lot of ways, I straight up agree.

You're right, it's really the CBT wave of interventions that brought in the push to focus on diagnosis diagnosis for a sense of legitimacy and to be reimbursed by insurance.

I actually have a different gripe with the psychoanalytic/psychodynamic approaches which is that they believe the problem is in the past and requires you to understand the past, and while your past events are certainly where a lot of your pain was learned, the resolution exists in the here and now. This is a bold claim, but once you understand that everything your mind does is a result of what you've experienced, what you've learned, and your genetics, and that everything you do makes sense in the context of what you've experienced, you no longer need to look back and ask why you do what you do. You simply need to understand that it makes sense, it's likely adaptive in the context of the past, and learn to respond in line with how you want to be right now. As a side effect, you often do end up being able to have understanding for certain behaviors that used to bother you, and may even find appreciation for them. For instance, it came to me recently that my habit of trying to read people was likely a result of having parents that didn't directly communicate, and while that used to cause me a lot of nervousness and relationship problems, it now serves as a wonderful tool for understanding.

You SHOULD be suspect of an approach that claims that someone will be better and stay better in just a few weeks. This is not that, and in fact, part of what I teach is that getting better is a regular practice that you'll need to continue applying in any moment for which you suffer. However, you'll want to practice because it's rewarding to go from suffering to relief, and suffering no longer becomes something to fear. It is a journey.

As a wise mentor of mine put it:

Feeling good is having a single moment of relief. Getting better is knowing that you can get back there whenever you find yourself feeling crappy again, and proving that to yourself over and over again.

This is that.

Thank you for your thoughtful and astute comments.
