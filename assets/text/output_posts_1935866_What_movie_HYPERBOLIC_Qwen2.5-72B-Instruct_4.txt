Oh wow I've never heard of The Man From Earth but that premise sounds absolutely fascinating I'm definitely going to have to check it out. A 14,000 year old history professor? That's such a unique and intriguing concept. Thanks for sharing this I'm really excited to see how the conversation unfolds and what the other professors think of his story. It sounds like a deep and thought-provoking film.
