Wow, this is incredible.  I'm really struggling with anxiety and depression right now, and the traditional therapy route just hasn't been clicking for me.  I feel like I'm constantly analyzing my symptoms instead of actually getting better. Your approach sounds so different, and honestly, a little refreshing. I'm definitely intrigued by the idea of self-mentorship. I'll check out your website and blog posts. Thanks for sharing your story and for being so open about your struggles. It gives me hope.  I'm curious, what would you say is the biggest misconception people have about mental health recovery?
